# Music Synthesis

## Introduction

A music synthesizer, or **synthesizer** (or just synth), is a programmable device which produces sounds in response to
being played or controlled by a musician or composer. Traditionally a music synthesizer generates sounds froms scratch by
creating and modifying fundamental waveforms. But that's not the only scenario, for example, **samplers** will sample a
sound, then edit it and store it back later as individual notes. Romplers are similar, except that they sounds are fixed in ROM.

Computational Music Synthesis fundamentals and algorithms. Main goal is to build a **computationl music synthesizer**. Inspo:
